# space-quiz-app

##Overview
I created this space quiz app using html, css, and javascript

This was great practice for understanding new JavaScript methods and logic I wasn't as familiar with before such as:
  - Array.from();
  - forEach()
  - .children
  - .dataset
It was also great because it gave me an excuse to play with loops, objects, and arrays more â€” which I haven't done much of until now.


##Learning Journey
Learning step by step each logic gave me a lot of insight into where I could improve, especially with the showQuestion function, and the selectAnswer function. 

##Future Plans
I will be updating this quiz as well as other quizzes as I continue progressing my skills.

Feel free to add changes as you please
